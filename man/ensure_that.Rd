\description{
This function queries an LLM to write unit tests for selected R code. To do
so, it:
\itemize{
\item Initializes a \code{\link[=ensurer]{ensurer()}}: an ellmer \link[ellmer:Chat]{Chat()} that knows how
to write testthat unit tests.
\item Reads the contents of the active \code{.R} file as well as the current selection.
\item Opens a corresponding test file (creating it if need be).
\item Asks the LLM to write unit tests for the current selection, using the
contents of the active \code{.R} file as context.
\item Streams the response into the corresponding test file.
}
