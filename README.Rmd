The ensure package provides an addin for drafting testthat unit testing code using LLMs. Triggering the addin will open a corresponding test file and begin writing tests into it. The _ensurer_ is familiar with testthat 3e as well as tidy style, and incorporates context from the rest of your R package to write concise and relevant tests.

## Installation

You can install ensure like so:

``` r
pak::pak("simonpcouch/ensure")
```

Then, make sure that you have an [`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`](https://console.anthropic.com/) environment variable set, and you're ready to go. If you'd like to use an LLM other than Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet—like OpenAI's ChatGPT or a local ollama model—to power the ensurer, set the `.ensure_fn` and `.ensure_args` options in your `.Rprofile`, like `options(.ensure_fn = "chat_openai")` to use OpenAI’s GPT-4o or `options(.ensure_fn = "chat_openai", .ensure_args = list(model = "gpt-4o-mini"))` to use their GPT-4o-mini model.

The ensurer is interfaced with the via the RStudio addin "ensure: Test R code." For easiest access, we recommend registering the ensure addin to a keyboard shortcut. **In RStudio**, navigate to `Tools > Modify Keyboard Shortcuts > Search "ensure"`—we suggest `Ctrl+Alt+T` (or `Ctrl+Cmd+T` on macOS). The ensurer is currently not available in Positron as Positron has yet to implement document `id`s that the package needs to toggle between source and test files.

Once those steps are completed, you're ready to use the ensure addin with a keyboard shortcut.

## Example

To use the ensurer, just trigger the addin (optionally selecting some code to only write tests for a certain portion of the file) and watch your testing code be written.

```{r}
#| label: ensure-gif
#| echo: false
#| fig-alt: "A screencast of an RStudio session, where the user has a source file open. Several functions in the source file are selected and a keyboard shortcut is pressed, at which point a corresponding test file is created and drafts of unit tests are streamed into the file."
